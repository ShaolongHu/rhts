    The PrintingParser classes want to have a filename so they can give
    useful error messages.

    However, annoyingly, fileinput.filename() only returns a value once input
    has been read from the string.

    So this class exists so that you can pass a string-like object around,
    and have the actual filename string generated later on, when needed, and when
    fileinput.filename() will be generating good output.
