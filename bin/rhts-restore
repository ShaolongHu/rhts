usage="Usage: $0 [OPTION]
Restore all files and directories backed up with rhts-backup.
Must be run as root to preserve all permissions and attributes.

    -h, -?, --help    display this help and exit

This tool is automatically run by RHTS when test completes.
If RHTS_BACKUP_DIR is set, data will be restored from that directory.

The tool does not remove new files appearing after backup has been made.
If you don't want to leave anything behind just remove the whole original
tree before running rhts-restore.
